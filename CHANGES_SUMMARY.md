# Stock Investment App - Changes Summary
## Version V0.1.1 Release

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Added SENSEX Stocks to Indian Analysis
**Problem**: Indian stock analysis only included NIFTY stocks
**Solution**: Expanded the Indian stock list to include both NIFTY 50 and SENSEX stocks

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `stock_investment_app.py` line ~315
- Added 15 additional SENSEX stocks: POWERGRID.NS, NTPC.NS, TATAMOTORS.NS, etc.
- Total Indian stocks increased from 15 to 30
- Added clear comments separating NIFTY and SENSEX stocks

### 2. ✅ Fixed Email Import Error
**Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'MimeText' from 'email.mime.text'`
**Root Cause**: Python 3.13 has changes in email module structure
**Solution**: Added robust import fallbacks

**Changes Made**:
- Updated import statements in `stock_investment_app.py` lines 10-20
- Added try-catch blocks for multiple import methods
- Supports both new and legacy Python email modules
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 3. ✅ Created Import Verification Tool
**Added**: `test_imports.py` - Tests all dependencies before running the app
**Features**:
- Checks all required modules
- Provides clear success/failure messages
- Shows Python version information
- Gives installation instructions for missing modules
